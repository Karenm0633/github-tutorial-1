## Git vs. GitHub

**Git** - a version control system software that is used to collaborate
with other people and track changes in your code. This program is used primarily to
track your code in Github, but Git can be used without Github, such as in your 
computer.  
  
  You can access the Git terminal by

**Github** - A website developed by Github Inc. that can be used to...   
* Store your code
* Share your code with other people
* Contribute to other people's code
* Learn from other programmers

#### **Q:**  So what's the difference between Git and Github?  
#### **A:**  Git is a software tool used to control versions of your code and Github is a service website that helps you store the code in a repository.
